# Decorator Design Pattern

[External Link](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/decorator/)

Helps in dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without modifying their existing code

> *Best Examples:*
>
> 1. Navigation System to find shortest route, fastest route etc. or walking route, bike route
     > (User can switch between the algorithms based on preference)
> 2. Cake Recipe: Strategies to make chocolate cake, pineapple cake etc.

So it is about choosing the best algorithm at runtime

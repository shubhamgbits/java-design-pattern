# Decorator Design Pattern

[External Link](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/adapter/)

Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, enabling compatibility.

(Wrapping an incompatible object to make it compatible with a class)

Example (Non-coding)
* Using memory card adapter to transfer files from memory card
* Power Adapter

Example (From personal Usage)
* Creating Adapter over CIS APIs
* Creating Adapter over Scheduler APIs

Good Example:
* If your app supports different type of payments,
  * Each payment provider can send a response which is slightly different
* Here, an adapter can be created to convert all different type of responses to a common response
